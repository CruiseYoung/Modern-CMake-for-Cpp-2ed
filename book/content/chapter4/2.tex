In Chapter 1, First Steps with CMake, we already looked at a simple project definition. Let’s revisit it. It is a directory with a CMakeLists.txt file that contains a few commands configuring the language processor:

\filename{chapter01/01-hello/CMakeLists.txt}

\begin{cmake}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.26)
project(Hello)
add_executable(Hello hello.cpp)
\end{cmake}

In the same chapter, in the section named Project files, we learned about a few basic commands. Let’s explain them in depth here.
