To build the examples provided in this chapter, use the following command:

\begin{shell}
cmake -B <build tree> -S <source tree> -G "Ninja" -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-18 && cmake --build <build tree>
\end{shell}

Be sure to replace the placeholders <build tree> and <source tree> with appropriate paths.
